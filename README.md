# Georgia Transit

This is a responsive web application which will allow users to get real time bus and train information for the state of Georgia. It will give the users same experience no matter what device they are using. Also, it is designed in such a way that even if there is no network available, the user will still be able to load the last fetched data and look at the train timings.
